<h1>Blackholes</h1> 
<section><h1>What is a blackhole</h1></section>
<p id="a">A black hole is a region of space where region spae where gravitational field is so intense that no matter or 
radiation can escape it . Since there is no light blackholes are invisible to us . Only space telescopes 
with special tools can see it . There gravity pull is so high because a lot ofmatter has been squeezed into
a tiny space. Blackholes come in differnet sizes such as the smalees blackhole is just of one atom. They may be very tiny 
but have the mass of a very large mountain. The other types of a black hole is known as a stellar blackhole . Their mass 20x the sun's mass
in the milky way . Rserach has shown us that there are supermassive blackholes too the mass is equivalent to 4 million suns.

<section><h1>Formation of a blackhole</h1></section>
<p id="b">Scientists think the smallest black holes formed when the universe began.
    Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or collapses.
     When this happens, it causes a supernova. 
    A supernova is an exploding star that blasts part of the star into space.
    Scientists think supermassive black holes were made at the same time as the galaxy they are in.</p>

<section><h1 id="blackholes">Types of blackholes</h1></section>
<p>There are many types of balcholes each of them are pretty unique</p>
<h3 id="Header">Stellar blackhole</h3>
<p>Stellar black holes form when the center of a very massive star collapses in upon itself. 
    This collapse also causes a supernova, or an exploding star, that blasts part of the star into space. 
    Scientists think supermassive black holes formed at the same time as the galaxy they are in.</p>
<h3 id="head1">Supermassive blackhole</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a supermassive black hole is the extended version of
     a normal black hole, meaning itâ€™s the same just bigger in size. Scientists and astronomers 
     not only believe that these are the largest black holes in existence, 
    but that they exist at the center of every galaxy as well, including our own.</p>
<h3 id="head2">Intermediate blackholes</h3>
<p>Intermediate Black Holes have masses that are in the range of mass of over hundreds of
     suns of our solar system taken together. These are significantly 
    larger than the stellar black holes but smaller in size than the supermassive black holes.</p>
